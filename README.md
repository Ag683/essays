Paragraph 1 HERE
The Anglo Dutch War was not the first time that Sheppey inhabitants suffered due to war, or the threat
of war, since it was almost a hundred years earlier in 1588 that concerns about the [Spanish
Armada](/16c/16c-spanish-armada), approaching London via the Kent coast, caused the Crown to
invest in fortifications at Queenborough Castle and Minster. In addition, Shurland Manor, Eastchurch
(owned by the Cheney family) held a large armoury of weapons according to the Crown, including 25
muskets, 50 pikes, 40 ‘halberdiers’ whilst the rest of Eastchurch parish held 24 ‘calivers’ and 35 bills
and 89 ‘able men’.[^ref1] In 1583, Edward Hoby of the Privy Council and nephew to Lord Burghley,
Treasurer of England, recorded his observation of the Sheppey people after they had been apparently
trained to defend the island and the entrance to the Thames, impending the Spanish invasion:

Overall, Hoby’s account provides a complex insight into the tensions between the Crown’s military
agenda and the everyday hardship of the local islanders, particularly in Eastchurch parish.
